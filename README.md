# Basics of NLP

SNo| Common NLP Tasks| Approaches to NLP| Challenge in NLP|
|-|-|-|-|
|1| Sentiment analysis|Heuristic methods|More than one meaning of a sentence|
|2| Conversational agents|Machine learning methods|Contextual words|
|3| Knowledge graph and QA systems|Deep learning methods|Colloquialisms, slang and idioms|
|4| Summarization|Deep learning algorithms retain data in sequential order|Tone diff (irony, sarcasm)|
|5| Topic modelling|Auto feature selection|Spelling errors|
|6| Typing behaviour|Creativity in poems, dialogue and script|Diversity of languages|
|7| Text parsing into noun verb|
|8| Speech to text|


# Day 1 

Text Preprocessing with Spacy : Cleaning and Transforming raw text data into a format that can be easily analyzed by machine learning algorithms.Some common task includes Tokenization,Lemmatization,Removing Punctuations.where i learned about the basics of spacy ,sentence boundary detections,token attributes,Part of speech tagging,name Entinty Reconition,word vector and spacy and spacy piplines.

# Day 2

Text Preprocessing with Spacy : I learned how to use spaCy as entityRuler,how to make ruler to correct entity.I also learned how to use the spaCy as Matcher,Attributed token by matcher,Applied matcher,greedy keyword,sorting to its apperence, Adding in sequence and used it to find quotes and speakers from the text.We use spaCy matcher over regex in linguistic components so that lemma of word or identifying if the word is a specific type of an entity.
